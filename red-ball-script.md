# Red Ball Riddle - Video Script

## Concept
Visual aid for voiceover. Minimal text, focus on animations/charts.

---

## Scene 1: The Setup
**Visual:** 10x10 grid of balls fades in. 99 red, 1 blue (blue in corner).
**On screen:** Just the balls. Maybe a small "99%" label.
**Purpose:** Establish the starting state visually.

---

## Scene 2: The Question
**Visual:** Highlight/pulse the blue ball. Then show "98%?" appearing.
**On screen:** Minimal - just the target percentage.
**Purpose:** Pose the question without spelling it out.

---

## Scene 3: The Intuition (Wrong)
**Visual:** 1 red ball fades out. Show percentage barely changes.
**On screen:** Updated percentage (still ~98.99%).
**Purpose:** Show that removing 1 ball does almost nothing.

---

## Scene 4: The Reveal
**Visual:** Red balls fade out one by one (or in groups), counter ticking down. Stop after removing three balls.
**On screen:** Counter showing red ball count.
**Purpose:** Make it clear that we need to remove many balls instead of few.

---

## Scene 5: The Reframe
**Visual:** Show the formula
**On screen:** "B / (R + B) = 98%".
**Purpose:** Make it systematic

---

## Scene 6: The Reframe
**Visual:** Show the formula turning into a line chart. 
**On screen:** "B / (R + B)" at first which transitions into the line chart where R is on the x-axis and the percentage on the y-axis.
**Purpose:** Make it visual again

---

## Scene 7: The Insight (Non-linear cost)
**Visual:** Show where the line y=0.98 and how many red balls need to be removed.
**Purpose:** Show the solution visually

---

## Scene 8: The formula
**Visual:** Show how you can also solve for B / (R + B). Then animate the starting point with all the balls and remove the ones that you do not need. 
**Purpose:** Show the solution more formally

---

## Scene 9: The Asymmetry
**Visual:** Animate the "Two Ways to Reduce Red Ball Percentage" chart from red-ball-riddle.py. First show the "remove-red-balls" line and then "add blue balls". 
**Purpose:** Show the counterintuitive asymmetry.
